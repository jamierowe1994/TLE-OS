 * ── Whose name (10 Sep 2026) ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * It was the word "James", typed in, for everybody: every agent who has ever
 * signed in has been greeted by the owner's name, and an owner viewing as
 * somebody else - which is exactly when you are checking that their account
 * looks right - was greeted as himself on their dashboard.
 *
 * The name comes from /api/auth/me, which reports the SUBJECT, so it is
 * theirs while a view-as is open and their own the rest of the time. Until
 * it answers there is no name at all rather than a guess: a greeting that
 * says the wrong name for half a second is worse than one that arrives a
 * moment late.

           him and are cut off at the rule rather than hanging into the page.
           The top is left open on purpose: the window runs off the top of the
           page and is cut by the window edge, which is the point of it.

           480 keeps the artwork the same width on screen as the version it
           replaces, so the greeting still gets its one line.

           backdrop was recoloured to each accent. James's new artwork has no
           backdrop at all, so there is nothing left to tint and nothing left
